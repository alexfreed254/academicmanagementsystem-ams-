# Thika Technical Training Institute — Academic Management System (TTTI AMS)

A full-stack web application for managing academic operations at Thika Technical Training Institute. Covers attendance, assessments, student clearance, industrial attachment, examinations, and institutional oversight across multiple departments and user roles.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.14 · Flask · Gunicorn |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Row Level Security) |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (JWT) for staff/employers · bcrypt hashed passwords for students |
| Storage | Supabase Storage (PDFs, images, evidence files) |
| Hosting | Render (Python web service, auto-deploy from GitHub) |
| Frontend | **React 18 + Vite** (SPA in `frontend/`) · Jinja2 portals still available during incremental migration · Tailwind CSS · Font Awesome |
| PDF generation | ReportLab |
| Excel export | openpyxl |

## System Architecture

```
Browser
  │
  ├─ React + Vite SPA (`frontend/`) ── Axios ──► Flask /api/v1/*
  │
  └─ Legacy Jinja portals (unchanged) ─────────► Flask HTML routes
         │
         ▼
Render (Gunicorn → Flask app)
  │
  ├── Supabase Auth  ← login / JWT / password reset
  ├── Supabase DB    ← all application data (PostgreSQL + RLS)
  └── Supabase Storage ← uploaded files (PDFs, photos, documents)
```

All data lives in Supabase. Render hosts the Python API. The React frontend is deployed separately (static hosting) and talks to Flask over `/api/v1`. See `frontend/README.md`.

Jinja templates remain until each screen is ported — **design is preserved**, only the frontend language changes.

## Security

- Passwords are **never stored** in the app database — Supabase Auth handles them with bcrypt
- The `service_role` key is only used server-side and never exposed to the browser
- RLS policies enforce department isolation at the database level
- Python decorators enforce role checks before any query runs
- Audit logs written to `system_logs` for every significant action
- Session cookies: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=None`
- JWT tokens refreshed automatically before expiry
- File uploads stored in Supabase Storage with bucket-level access policies

---

## Setup

### 1. Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. SQL Editor → run `supabase_schema.sql`
3. Project Settings → API → copy: Project URL, `anon` key, `service_role` key
4. Storage → create public buckets: `assessment-scripts`, `assessment-evidence`, `documents`

### 2. Create Super Admin

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor after creating the user in Auth → Users
INSERT INTO user_profiles (id, full_name, role, is_active)
VALUES ('PASTE-UUID-HERE', 'Super Admin', 'super_admin', TRUE)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET role = 'super_admin', is_active = TRUE;
```

### 3. Local Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SECRET_KEY
flask run
```

### 4. Deploy to Render

1. Push repo to GitHub
2. Render Dashboard → New Web Service → connect repo
3. Render auto-detects `render.yaml`
4. Set environment variables: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`
